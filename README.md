# Web3 ERC20 Token Balance Indexer

The Web3 ERC20 Token Balance Indexing Project is designed to retrieve and index the balances of users' ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum Mainnet. This project utilizes the subsquid library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, specifically focusing on ERC20 token contracts. The indexed data can be utilized for various purposes such as analytics, reporting, and monitoring user token balances.



## Introduction

The project focuses on indexing the balances of ERC20 tokens by utilizing the Ethereum blockchain and Web3 technology. It employs a processor that interacts with Ethereum smart contracts to retrieve token balance data and stores it in a database for efficient querying. The indexed data can be used for various purposes, such as generating token holders' reports, monitoring token distribution, and tracking token usage over time.

## Features

- **Balance Indexing:** Retrieve and index ERC20 token balances of users on the Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Efficient Storage:** Utilize a database to store indexed token balance data for quick and efficient querying.
- **Customizable:** The project can be extended to index other relevant information from Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Automated Processing:** Employ a processor to periodically update the indexed data to reflect the latest token balances.
- **User-Friendly:** The project is designed to be easy to set up and configure, making it accessible to developers and users.

## Getting Started
